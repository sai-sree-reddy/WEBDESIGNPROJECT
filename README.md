#NU Student Companion

### Clone the repo
```bash
git@github.com/sai-sree-reddy/WEBDESIGNPROJECT.git
```

## Description
NU Student Companion is an one stop,all inclusive solution for day-to-day activity tracker for students. It enables students to monitor various aspects of their daily health routine, including food intake, water consumption, exercise, sleep patterns, study time and other physical activities.
 By keeping track of these metrics over time, users can easily evaluate their progress towards their goals. Essentially, Student Companion provides a convenient and centralized location for users to monitor and optimize their overall health and wellbeing.
This application will have a responsive user interface designed using SASS and built using ReactJS. It will be backed by a scalable NodeJS server that utilizes the ExpressJS middleware to route requests to appropriate business logic functions. User input and displayed information will be stored in MongoDB. The application will also leverage multiple open-source APIs to enhance its functionality, including weather, events, and social sharing.
